## Module Overview: version

The `version` module is designated for maintaining and accessing the version information of a software package or application. The module consists mainly of a single string variable `__version__` that holds the version identifier as a string. In the provided context, the `version` module contains the version `0.0.7`, which likely represents an early development stage or a patch in the software's lifecycle.

This module can be queried to check the current version of the application, to ensure compatibility with other modules or to verify that the most recent version of the application is being used. It is a common practice in Python development to include a `__version__` variable in a module so that users and developers can easily access and verify the version of the software.

Typically, the version information adheres to Semantic Versioning, where the version number itself is composed of three segments:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Given that the version mentioned here is `0.0.7`, it suggests that the software has not yet had a release that warrants incrementing the major or minor version numbers, and has instead been focused on iterative patch work or small, compatible changes and fixes.
